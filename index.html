        <h1>Matthieu Resurreccion</h1>
        <h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>I am a senior Computer Science undergraduate at California State University, Northridge (CSUN), passionate about 
            solving both real-world and abstract problems. My academic and coding journey has developed my skills in data structures, 
            API integration, and Agile project management. I plan to begin my career in full-stack development and gradually transition 
            into machine learning and AI.
        </p>
        <p>My programming experience includes C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python, along with web technologies such as HTML and CSS. 
            I’ve built projects with the MERN stack, integrating WebSockets and Google OAuth 2.0 to strengthen my understanding of HTTP 
            protocols and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). I also enjoy recreational projects, from scripting in Roblox to creating a guitar scale 
            application in Java Swing. Beyond coding, I am deeply engaged in mathematics and enjoy writing in LaTeX. In 2022, I received the 
            Honors in Mathematics award.
